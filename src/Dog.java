public class Dog {

//    You should have private instance variables/fields for all the data members.
//    You should have a constructor that sets the initial state of the data members via passed parameters.
//    Think about what data-types the fields and parameters will need!!!
//    You should have 4 instance methods for eat, run, sleep, and name
//    You should have a main method that creates the 3 Dog objects in the diagram.
//    Make at least 2 of your methods functional (i.e. perform some action)!!!
//    For Example: method eat might take a class parameter named Food (i.e. another class) that has a field weight, and your eat method might reduce the weight in Food.
